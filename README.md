## Game Mechanics

### Basic Physics
- **Screen Size**: 1600x1200 pixels (high-resolution, fullscreen display)
- **Bat Sizes**: 
  - Normal: 121x90 pixels (bat1/bat2)
  - Dead: 85x90 pixels (bat_dead)
  - Fever: 204x180 pixels (bat_fever - 2x larger)
- **Jump Force**: -16 velocity units
- **Gravity**: 1.0 acceleration per frame (bat), 0.3 (rock pieces)
- **Movement Speeds**: 
  - Normal: 6 pixels per frame
  - Fever Mode: 24 pixels per frame (4x faster)
- **Rock Specifications**: 
  - Width: 160 pixels
  - Gap: 360 pixels between rock pillars
  - Spawn Rate: Every 90 frames (~1.5 seconds at 60 FPS)
- **Cave Boundaries**: 60px ceiling and floor collision zones

### Fever Mode Mechanics
- **Activation**: Collect torch (spawns every 10 obstacles)
- **Torch Size**: 51x90 pixels (170x300 source ratio)
- **Duration**: 300 frames (5 seconds at 60 FPS)
- **Effects**: Giant size, 4x speed, invincibility to rocks
- **Visual Timer**: Real-time countdown bar display

### Animation System
- **Normal Mode Animations**:
  - Jump: Wings spread (bat1) ‚Üí Wings folded (bat2)
  - Falling: Wings spread for gliding
  - Idle: Natural wing flapping cycle (20 frames)
  - Rapid Input: Faster wing animation on consecutive jumps
  - Timing: 12 frames (normal), 8 frames (rapid)
- **Fever Mode**: Giant bat_fever sprite with enhanced visual effects
- **Death Animation**: bat_dead sprite with rotation effects

### Collision & Destruction
- **Collision Detection**: Precise collision matching visual boundaries
- **Rock Destruction**: Individual 90-pixel rock pieces with realistic physics
