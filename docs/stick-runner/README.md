## Game Mechanics

### Obstacle System
- **High Obstacles (Red)**: 
  - Height: Above player's normal running position
  - Avoidance: Use slide action to duck underneath
  - Visual: Red colored geometric shapes
- **Low Obstacles (Teal)**:
  - Height: At ground level blocking normal running
  - Avoidance: Use jump action to leap over
  - Visual: Teal/cyan colored geometric shapes
- **Spawn Pattern**: Obstacles appear at regular intervals with increasing frequency
- **Collision Detection**: Precise 3D collision detection with player model

### Scoring System
- **Obstacle Points**: 10 points per successfully avoided obstacle
- **Distance Scoring**: Points awarded based on total distance traveled
- **Speed Multiplier**: Higher speeds yield increased point values
- **Bonus System**: Consecutive successful obstacle avoidance provides bonus points

### Physics & Movement
- **Running Speed**: Starts at base speed, increases with distance
- **Jump Mechanics**: Fixed jump height and duration with gravity
- **Slide Mechanics**: Temporary height reduction for ducking
- **Collision Response**: Immediate game over on obstacle contact
- **Animation Timing**: Smooth transitions between run, jump, and slide states

## Asset Requirements

### 3D Models & Textures
- **Character Model**: Stick figure with run/jump/slide animations
